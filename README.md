The smart car is based on the CV1800B chip. 
With the memory up to 64MB, we can't run any python code in it efficently, acutually, only few MB memroy is avaible in it.
So, all the code run on it is written by c or cpp.

# Avoid 
The fucking car use MPU6050 and VL53L0X to get the right angle and the distance.
It can run in line even with the bad wheel. And it can turn to the angle of \pi /2  wonderfully.

# Camera Track
Duo to the fucking CV1800B chip and memory, the computer vision code is running on computer.
It can track the people or any thing supported by yolov5.

# Det

# Line 
run in line

# MPU 
code for mup6050

# Spdsen
unfinished 

# TDP

# Track
